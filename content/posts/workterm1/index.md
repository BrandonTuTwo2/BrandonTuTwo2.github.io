## Introduction

My name is Brandon Tu and I am going into my third year of university majoring in software engineering, this post is about my 4-month work term(and first work term ever) at System1. In this post I will be discussing what System1 does, my goals for the work term, what I did at the company, some final remarks, and acknowledgements to the wonderful people who helped me out.

## About System1

System1 is a technology company that specializes in Responsive Acquisition Marketing Platforms and has a plethora of brands and websites across the internet ranging from heath to cars. Fun fact the team I am part of (Publishing Front End) is a combination of 2 companies that were acquired by System1 (Qool Media and Concourse) here in Guelph.

## Goals

I had 3 main goals for this co-op term; the first was to learn more about web development technology (like PHP, SCSS, HTML, and JS) to further my knowledge of the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications. The second was to advance my problem-solving skills so I could better solve issues without help and debug my code efficiently. My final goal was to improve upon my collaborative skills and ability to communicate with my peers.

- Becoming more familiar with PHP - Throughout my work term, I became more proficient in Javascript and CSS while learning PHP, WordPress, and SCSS because I had to help create and maintain a plethora of WordPress templates for different sites to use and create functions that allow a single template to be used in different sites.

- Problem Solving Abilities - During my work term (especially in the beginning) I had lots of issues I had to overcome whether that be setting up the work environment or making sure a certain component was able to run on all sites, and in tackling these problems I feel that I became better at finding the solution and better at understanding what I need to research to solve the problem at hand 

- Becoming more collaborative - At system1 I was part of a team of around 13 and throughout the internship, I had daily standups where we discussed our progress and any issues we have with our current tasks. In doing these daily standups I got to better communicate my thoughts and concerns which in turn allowed me to develop my collaborative skills.

## Job Description

As a Jr. Fullstack Developer, I was tasked with creating, maintaining, and refactoring various websites that the company-owned. This entailed creating newly requested features, redesigning old sites to be more modern and using new functions to increase websites speed, and even helping create new sites from scratch based on mock designs. Throughout the job, most of the tasks required the usage of PHP while more front-end and styling tasks required me to use JS and SCSS (which were then compiled to CSS). One project that I enjoyed was the opportunity to help create a website from start to finish, as this allowed me to experience all the steps that go into creating a website from a mock to a working product and allowed me to get a better understanding of the whole web development process.

## Conclusion

I enjoyed my time at System1 as it allowed me to learn more about web development and get the chance to understand how different technologies and languages work together to form a full-fledged product. Furthermore, System1 is full of warm people who are always willing to help one another and I couldnâ€™t ask for a better place to have my first work term and people to learn from.

## Acknowledgement

I would love to thank my mentor Jonathan Li Kam Wa for always helping me and answering my (sometimes dumb) questions, Joel Tersigni for always giving me new challenges for me to tackle and memes to laugh at and Sam Hebeisen for always making me feel including and telling me about company events to go to.
