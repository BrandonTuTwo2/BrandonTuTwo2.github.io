## Introduction

My name is Brandon Tu and I am going into my fourth year of university majoring in software engineering. This post is about my second 4-month work term at System1. In this post I will be discussing my goals for the work term, what I did at the company, some differences between my first and second work term, some final remarks, and acknowledgements to the wonderful people who helped me out.

## Goals

The 3 main goals I had for this work term was to become more familiar with web development languages such as PHP and Javascript and how they work in tandem and learn more about the different API calls they have, to become better at communicating and working with others and to further develop my abilities to problem solve and write cleaner less fallible code.

- Become more familiar with web languages -  Throughout my work term I did extensive work using Javascript, specially working on a Javascript library and rewriting various pieces of it to match modern standards, in doing so I further deepened my understanding of Javascript, learning how to use different API calls to solve issues that I had and even had the chance to make my own API that would make it easier to use the Javascript library we were making, overall I developed a better coding style that follows standards. I however did not get much of a change to work with PHP but I felt that my extensive work with Javascript more than made up for that.

- Developing my communication abilities -  Since I had the opportunity to work in the office with the other software engineers I got to further develop my in person communication abilities and got to collaborate with others in person which in turn helped me become more comfortable sharing my ideas and talking about them.

- Further developing problem solving abilities - During my work term I was given a massive project to rework a Javascript library to make it more accessible and easier for sites to onboard and use. In doing the project I had to problem solve and come up with various solutions that could be used given the restraints I had which developed my problem solving abilities searching for solutions that matched the criteria I had.

## Job Description

This work term I was still a Jr. full stack developer but was part of the Platform and Engagement team (PLTE) where we mainly worked on the ad injection into a site using various Javascript libraries that we use and maintain to bundle and inject ad logic onto web pages. As mentioned already, one project which I really liked was the one where I was tasked to rewrite a specific library to be easier to use and onboard new sites onto it quickly and easily.

## Differences between First and Second Work Term

The major difference compared to my first work term and second work term at System1 was that instead of working on creating websites (using CSS, Javascript, PHP and Wordpress) I worked more on the behind the scenes ad injection which was mainly done in Javascript, flow and angular typescript. Additionally, since the office became more accessible due to the loosening of the covid-19 restriction I was able to work more in the office and experience a more typical co-op work term.


## Conclusion

In conclusion, I really valued my time at System1 once again as I got to learn more about working on a big Javascript library and and better understand how the library is used to produce content onto other webpages. Additionally, the people were always willing to lend me a hand and answer my questions if I had any and genuinely wanted me to learn which helped develop my confidence as a software engineer.

## Acknowledgement

Once again, I would like to thank my mentor Jonathan Li Kam Wa and the rest of the PLTE team for teaching more and being patient with me.
