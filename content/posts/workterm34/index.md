## Introduction

Hey there, I’m Brandon Tu and I’m going into my final 2 semesters of university majoring in software engineering with a minor in business. This will be my final post on my work term experience detailing the final 8 months of my  time at System1 which I was interning at for all of my other work terms. This post will start with the 3 goals I had this work term, the updated job description for my role, differences between my previous work terms and this one, and a conclusion and acknowledgment to the people that helped me during my time at System1. I hope you enjoy reading this!


## About System1

System1 is a technology advertising company that specializes in created software to streamline the process of rendering ads on a website, along with that System1 owns a plethora of websites and other software that we manage that are not advertising related. Fun fact the Guelph office/branch which I work at was actually 2 companies(concourse and Qool Media) that got acquired by System1.

## Goals

The 3 goals I had for my last work term was to develop a greater understanding of typescript and angular typescript, take a greater initiative in learning new technologies and learning more about AWS technologies and how to leverage them.

- Typescript - During this work term I had the opportunity to help develop a new ad distribution script with my team and both the client and server portion of the script was created with typescript. Thanks to being part of that project from start to MVP to being actually used in production I was able to develop my understanding of typescript further and better understand best practices when writing typescript.

- Learning new technologies - I think this work term I had a great opportunity to learn new technologies since when I started my team was tasked with creating a more streamlined ad delivery solution so I had plenty of opportunities to learn work with various different technologies such as snowflake, typescript, severless and other aws technologies.

- Learning about AWS technologies - During this work term I got to have more hands-on experience in working with AWS technologies since we relied on S3 and AWS lambda to host and run our project. In doing so I got a better understanding of how to configure Lambda and other AWS technologies via severless. I also learned how to measure various statistics related to our project such as cold start rates lambda invocations etc etc.

## Job Description

For my final work term, I was once again part of the Platform and Engagement team (PLTE). When I started my final work term the team was in the midst of planning a new project that would streamline how we deliver specific ads called Google RSoCs(related search on content) which uses the Google API to deliver relevant links to the page. In working on this project I had to be in various architect meetings where we discussed how we would design and implement this solution and I also had a hand in writing various functions and configurations that the solution would use/rely on

## Differences between First and Second Work Term

I think the biggest difference between previous work terms and this one was that I was able to design and develop a new piece of software from start to being used in production which was very exciting and insightful into the software development process. Compared to previous work terms I was more involved in not only the coding aspect of the product but also the design aspect of the product which made me join a lot more meetings(usually discussing the design) when compared to previous work terms. Additionally, as compared to the last work terms I felt that I had more responsibility and say when developing the software since I was with System1 for a long time and I was more trusted since I had already proven myself to my other peers.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I enjoyed my time at System1 because I felt that this work term was when I came out of my shell and participated more in the design process and the company overall. I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to join at a time when my team was developing a new product and was grateful for being a part of it and leaving my mark on the company. I hope that in the future I can come back to System1 if the chance occurs and I will take all that I learned there to heart.

## Acknowledgement

I would like to thank everyone that I worked with throughout my time at System1 such as Alan, Spencer, Jonathan, Paul, Dave, and Phil, and my wonderful team PLTE for helping nurture me and being patient with me. I hope that we will all meet again someday.
